# Rating enrichment items by group-housed laboratory mice in multiple binary choice tests using an RFID-based tracking system
Here the templates for the selfprinted 3D Models of the flap puzzle and the treat ball used in the above mentioned paper can be found, as well as the raw data tables S1, S2, S3. 

The 3 D templates used in the above mentioned study can be found as an ".stl" file. All templates were printed on Ultimaker 3S or SE with the use of PLA as printing material with no additional supporting material. 

PLA: Ultimaker original PLA schwarz or https://www.filamentworld.de/shop/pla-filament-3d-drucker/3d-drucker-pla-filament-3mm-schwarz/

Raw data tables are given as pdf documents:

S Table 1. Raw data of the single paired comparisons of the enrichments of the categories foraging, structural and housing over the entire test period of 46 hours.

S Table 2. Raw data of the single paired comparisons of the enrichments of the categories foraging, structural and housing over the active time of the 46-hour testing cycle.
